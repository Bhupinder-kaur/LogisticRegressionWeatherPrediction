🌦️ Predicting Weather with Machine Learning: Will It Rain Tomorrow? 🌧️

Excited to share my recent project where I built a weather prediction model using advanced machine learning techniques! This model analyzes historical weather data and predicts the probability of rain for the next day. Here’s an overview of the steps involved:

🔍 Data Exploration & Preprocessing:

Analyzed missing values in both categorical and numerical variables.
Applied date feature engineering, converting the 'Date' column into year, month, and day components for improved modeling.
Handled missing data using appropriate strategies like mean imputation for numerical features and mode imputation for categorical features.
⚙️ Feature Engineering:

Encoded categorical features such as Location and Wind Direction using binary encoding and one-hot encoding to prepare the dataset for machine learning.
Addressed outliers in features like Rainfall and WindSpeed using IQR-based filtering.
Scaled numerical features with StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.
📊 Modeling:

Implemented a Logistic Regression model to predict whether it will rain tomorrow, training the model using training-test split and evaluating its performance on unseen data.
Measured model performance with key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity.
Used a confusion matrix and heatmaps to visualize model predictions and evaluate classification outcomes.
🔧 Technologies & Libraries:

Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn)
Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization
Feature encoding with category_encoders library
📈 Results:

The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of X.XX%, and the classification report highlighted the precision and recall values for both the rainy and non-rainy classes.
Visualized the model performance with probability predictions and classification heatmaps to interpret the predictions better.
This project enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. The model could be further extended with other machine learning algorithms to enhance performance!

💡 Next Steps: Plan to test this model with more complex algorithms like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting to compare performance.
